        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I consider myself as an international person because of various reasons. One being the fact that I am a <strong>Cambodian</strong> who studied in a <strong>French</strong> school and speaks <strong>English</strong> fluenty while also having a <strong>Chinese</strong> background.
          Two being the fact that I am an international student! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to live in Cambodia for my whole life and now I live <strong>9 334 km</strong> away from home. It was challenging at first but I am getting used to it now.

        <h3>What I Did That I Find Interesting</h3>
         <p>
           I have already visited 14 countries and I am looking forward to expand my travel destinations now that I am living in Europe. This is a perfect opportunity to visit more countries. 
         </p>
         <p>
           I was once selected to go play volleyball with my school team in Singapore. It was an amazing experience and it was also my first time playing against players from 11 other countries.

         <p>
           Back home, two of my friends and I launched a Powerlifting Accessory Shop. It was called Peaches and we are still working on it today but we decide to rename it to Rahu (រាហ៊ូ).
